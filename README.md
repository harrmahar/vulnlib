# üìñ Vulnerable Library Management System (VulnLib)

Vulnlib is a **deliberately vulnerable web application** designed to simulate a real-world **Library Management System (LMS)**.  
It is intended for **learning and practicing web penetration testing** in a safe and controlled environment.  
The system mimics the features of a typical library application while intentionally containing various security flaws for training purposes.  
Live Demo: https://vulnlib.helium.sh/

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning!**  
This project is **for educational use only**. Do not deploy or expose Vulnlib to public/production environments.
